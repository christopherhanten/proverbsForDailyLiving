    <b> The Prayer List</><br/><br/>
      A prayer list is place to ask for prayer for yourself or someone else. I've tried to implement an easy way for folks to provide those in need of prayer, and connect it to those people who feel the joy of praying for others. Feel free to enter information about those in need of prayer on this page. The information will then be provided to those who would like to pray for others.

      If you would like to pray for others, please check the 'I would like to be a prayer person' box on your profile page. You will then be sent the current prayer list. Thank you for your prayers.
