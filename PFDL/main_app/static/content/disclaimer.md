I want to take a moment to say that, I have copied the book 'Proverbs for Daily Living' directly as it is presented in the book. The punctuation and spellings are not always how I would present them. Also, some of the proverbs are a little bit sexist. Again, I copied them directly. Please take these nuggets of wisdom and apply them to you life as you way. This book is quite old; the way things are stated in out current day, are not the same as they were back then. Please do not let the way that it was written keep you from applying the wisdom passed down within.
