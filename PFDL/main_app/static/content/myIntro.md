#<b>My Introduction of the Book</b><br/><br/>

I came across 'Proverbs for Daily Living' at a Goodwill in Nacogdoches, Texas in 2002. Since then, I've read a proverb, from the book, virtually every day since. I've written the proverbs daily several times. I find it funny, that when a friend visits me that I haven't seen in years, they mention that it's cool that I still have, and read the book, everyday. There's not much information out on the web about the book. I know that it was published by Peter Pauper Press, Chicago, in the 1950s. There are a few copies available to buy out in the world. I have decided with this project, to digitize the edition, to make it available for future generations. This book has had more impact on my life, and the person that I am, that any other. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have.
