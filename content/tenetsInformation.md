#<b>The Tenets of a Good Life</b><br/><br/>
1. <b>Spread Joy; Stand Firm</b></br>
    This is the main focus of life. Joy is one of the most important things in living a good life. Finding joy within oneself is hard; it is a lifelong struggle. Once a person has found that joy within their own life, it is their burden to spread this joy to others. While spreading joy is an activity that, by its nature is pacifist, one cannot allow others to take advantage of this. One must stand firm in their beliefs, in their safety, and in the joy held within.<br/><br/>
2. <b>Look Around; Not Down</b><br/>
    We live in a world where most of the people that you see are looking down at their devices. During development bootcamp, a survey was noticed, each time that there were greater than 3 humans in an elevator, 50%, or more, were looking at a device. Outside, one one would and the same thing. To borrow, and amend the quote, made famous, by John Lennon,<br/><br/>
    <i>"Life is what is happening while you're looking down at you device."<br/><br/>
    Look up and around; see the beauty that is our world.</i><br/><br/>
3. <b>Do what you do</b><br/>
    Humans are unique and totally complicated. We all have things that we do to make make our journey through life, at the least, bearable, even better, joyous. Our journey is our's alone. To quote Guru, of Gang Starr,<br/><br/>
    <i>"We don't know the hardships people don't speak of."</i><br/><br/>
    It's not our place to judge others about what they do to get through their own life. If we stay in our own lane, working for our own joy, we should should allow other humans to be in their own lane as well. This, of course, is only feasible to a certain extent. It is the time to stand firm, when another human's lane crosses into yours and diminishes your joy.<br/><br/>
4. <b>Same Ole G (Samogee)</b><br/>
    This idea sprung rom the R&B singer, Ginuwine. This song will it touch a chord inside of a person. The hook of the song is as follows:<br/><br/>
    <i>"Even though I got my own CD, Maybe even on TV, There ain't no changing me, I can only be me me me. Even though I might be on TV, Cause I got my own CD, All you will ever see, Same ol' G."</i><br/><br/>
    This simple hook to be a way to judge oneself, to verify that no matter how high, or how low you go, you remain the same person. I followed this with a lyric of my own: "If you knew me then, you know me know." If one verifies oneself against this, and can say "I have stayed the same," they are living authentically. This doesn't mean you cannot change your opinions, your looks, and your state of mind--This only refers to ones behavior and treatment of others.
